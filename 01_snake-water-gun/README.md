Snake Water and Gun game

This is a simple Python mini-project based on the classic **Snake-Water-Gun** game.

### 🧠 How it works
  -The player selects one option: Snake 🐍, Water 💧, or Gun 🔫  
  - The computer randomly selects one too  
  - The winner is decided based on:
  - Snake drinks Water 🐍💧 → Snake wins  
  - Gun shoots Snake 🔫🐍 → Gun wins  
  - Water douses Gun 💧🔫 → Water wins  
  - If both choose the same → It’s a draw 😄
